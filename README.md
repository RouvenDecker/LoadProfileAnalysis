# LoadProfileAnalysis

Simple tool to generate visual insight for anualy Load Profile.
(Check Folder "Output")

The current version does not delete files on its own.  
In order to use it:  
1 ) replace "Load_Profile_Analysis.csv" with your data (use the same table format, and filename "name edits will come in the commandline version")  
2 ) delete old Outputs and the database.db file (current version does not overwrite existing files)  

check out commandline branch for more options (still in development)
