# LoadProfileAnalysis

Simple tool to generate visual insight for anualy Load Profile.  
The current version does not delete files on its own.  
In order to use it:  
1 ) replace "Load_Profile_Analysis.csv" with your data (use the same table format)  
2 ) delete old Outputs and the database.db file (current version does not overwrite)  

check out commandline branch for more options (still in development)
